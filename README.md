-Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, Rainbow Friends, The Coffin of Andy and Leyley, Garten of BanBan, Smiling Critters fandoms dni...

-people under 11 please... no don't interact (I am not a weirdo, some of my friends were 11 even if im 14 - 15... I CAN be wholesome and sweet.)

-Pushy, fake, Distant friends (Unfriend me or just dni at that point..)

-Fake rumors of me??? (Example: I don't even ship cosmo x ginger)

-WEIRD FREAKS on PT that I'm not close with

-People who don't like accept anything that I like such as Ships.

-People who think they're funny to just slip on a satire pony, walk around rent free, and annoy the shit out of me.

-Anyone who ships Ginger with Bobette... ;-; (I'm not that kind of gal... Sorry, ALSO IF WERE FRIENDS YOU ARE FINE..)

-Censoring my name or calling me narcissitic or Schizophrenic (The schizo can be a joke but put a ./j)..
