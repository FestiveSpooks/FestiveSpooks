more info: literally it was old drama going on and now ppl are bringing it back..??? ;-; I am not problematic... Maybe I was then, I am not sure but I literally am innocent... This is why I literally did another github make over atp.. and a literal plead.

can lowk ppl plsplss stop harassing me wth guys...  ppls be like... not getting over things that don't involve them..? Just random ppl- stinker bru. I have been blocked, hidden, slander behind my back and I find out like not long ago because my chronoically online friend was witnessing a group say I was weird and stuff.. but they weren't specific...? And some guy I "dated" then (Not silo), saying how after I broke up with him I treated this guy wrong... HE FORCED ME TO LITERALLY TYPE MY ADDRESS TO HIS GOOGLE MAPS HELLO??? I said no a dozens of times and they just... constantly are weird, and I heard some goofy ah rumors of something disgusting he did this year and I made fun of it but then Ig irl ppl friends of his heard and know my socials and started slandering at me so yay..???;-; dont know how to react to this stupid online critics, If there is anything else someone has to say, atp.. say it to my personal accs cuz i am js done. And if your going to "slander and trash talk" abt me then do it private and not in public on pt?? That's literally embarassing that I have to go through fake allegations and be like.. "This isn't... true???" Because who in the world says I am 28 and hang out with ... teens../???? ;-; no proof so why spill? I try my best to be nice to all people. I try my best to keep my cool. Dropping fake info, and just info in general crosses that line.
its so stupid that people like me have to go through this everyday, literally- have some gosh darn sympathy for once in humanity.
